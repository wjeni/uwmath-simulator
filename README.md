## About the Project

Our project includes 4 html pages, namely classroom front view, left view, right view and board view.  
We also incorporated interactive components using JavaScript. 

Front: contains links to the left, right and board views  
Left: a classmate sitting to the left  
Right: an interactive classmate sitting to the right  
Board: a filtered real-life photo of a math lecture blackboard with an interactive comment

Below is a preview of the front view:
